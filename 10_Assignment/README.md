##JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator | Example | Same As
-------- | ------- | -------
= | x = y | x = y
+= | x += y | x = x + y
-= | x -= y | x = x - y
*= | x *= y | x = x * y
/= | x /= y | x = x / y
%= | x %= y | x = x % y

The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

```javascript
var x = 10;
```

The += assignment operator adds a value to a variable.

```javascript
var x = 10;
x += 5;
```

The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.

```javascript
var x = 10;
x -= 5;
```

The *= assignment operator multiplies a variable

```javascript
var x = 10;
x *= 5;
```

The /= assignment divides a variable.

```javascript
var x = 10;
x /= 5;
```

The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

```javascript
var x = 10;
x %= 5;
```
